# PokeRogue Move Effectiveness Extension
This is a Chrome extension that adds an overlay that shows the effectiveness of each available move against the enemy's types.

## Current state
The extension is still under development and is not yet ready for use. It's missing:
- A way to discern which are the active pokemon envolved in the battle
- (maybe) positioning the effectiveness badges next to each move in the UI

## Credits
This extension is heavily "inspired" by the [RogueDex extension](https://github.com/roguedex-dev/roguedex). While no code was directly copied, many ideas and techniques were borrowed from it.

The moves DB was sourced from [pokemon-data.json](https://github.com/Purukitto/pokemon-data.json).
